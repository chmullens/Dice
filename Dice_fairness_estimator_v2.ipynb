    "## Dice fairness estimator for d20 dice\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I estimate the likelihood that a 20-sided dice is fair. Fortunately, I had a couple of test dice: one relatively fair, and one with visible structural flaws that cause some sides to occur less often. These dice provided the test sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key outputs: an interactive visualization showing a dice's hot and cold spots, and a plot of whether a given distribution is likely to have occurred randomly. \n",

    "Tools: Monte Carlo methods, 3D vector math, sphere fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using Monte Carlo data simulation as the basis for the statistics, since I want to compare against a perfectly random distribution. If the specific likelihood of a one-in-a-billion event mattered, this would be a bad solution, but I'm interested in common events, so this works great. "

    "And stats-wise... looking at Dice 0, when \"biasvec\" input is set to true, you can see the bias vector. It's the little green thing, and it doesn't seem to be a helpful indicator of which faces have more rolls. It's not wrong, but it's not helpful. Offsetting a sphere has the same problem. Either is *accurate*, but not very *useful*, because the dice is biased by face geometry, not weight. There is still enough bias toward one side that they do tell you something, like pointing away from the cold spot on Dice 0, but the displayed dice does better.\n",

    "I am reasonably sure that dice 0 (the Orange dice) is somewhat biased, given the large difference between the sides, and the fact that there is a clear order to it. However, that order is not what I was expecting. It looks like there's a cold spot, but instead of the corresponding higher areas being on the opposite side from the cold spot (like you might expect if the dice was heavier on one side), the hottest spots are right around the edge. This suggests that rather than having a weight imbalance, it has an edge imbalance. Perhaps the edges around 7 (opposite 14), may be less pronounced. This would lead to the dice tending to continue rolling, rather than stopping with that face down. \n",

    "Even if you roll over a thousand times, one of your faces may come up more than twice as often as another by completely random chance. That also means that if your dice is biased so that one face comes up twice as often as another, it's difficult to say so reliably. A d20 has enough potential values that doing practical testing for even fairly large biases takes a LOT of time if you want to be sure *how much* bias there is.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, we can tell that a dice *is biased in some way* much earlier. We can use a chi-squared test to determine whether the distribution of numbers you rolled is feasible from an unbiased distribution. Established power tests let us estimate how many times we'd need to roll to see an effect. From the basic chi-squared power test using Cohen's \"w\" for power,\\* you can calculate how many rolls you would need to detect: 1) An effect size of 0.5, with 2) a probability of 0.05 for false negative, 3) detected 80% of the time (a standard metric for power estimates, for whatever reason). Using those numbers, we get an estimate of a bit over 150 rolls. If your dice is pretty heavily biased for or against *one* face, that's about how many it takes to be reasonably sure. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\**(iffy with this many categories, but still commonly used for power estimates as far as I can tell)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for our statistical tools, dice are a physical object, and it's usually not one face. Faces can't be assumed to be independent. The odds for a face depend directly on the odds for adjacent faces, due to the nature of the object. If the dice is weighted, numbers toward one side will be more common. If the dice has face distortions, numbers with sharper edges on the opposite face may be more commonly rolled, and edges and corners affect multiple faces. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, I have a dice that I know to be somewhat biased, which I've rolled a bit over 2000 times, and \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dice are physical objects, not a set of assumed-unrelated categories, which the Chi-Squared test is basing its measurements on. For a dice that is biased by varying edge sharpness, for example, a number that occurs more often may . Why? If you're tending to roll \"past\" some face because its edges are smooth, you'd expect the next face in line (whichever one that is) to happen more often. "
